     <p>The hardware of the computer is usually divided into three major parts, the central processing unit (CPU) contains an arithmetic and logic unit for manipulating data, a number of registers for storing data, and control circuits for fetching and executing instructions. The memory of a computer contains storage for instructions and data. It is called a random access memory (RAM) because the CPU can access any location in memory at random and retrieve the binary information within a fixed interval of time. The input and output processor (IOP) contains electronic circuits for communicating and controlling the transfer of information between the computer and the outside world. The input and output devices connected to the computer include keyboards, printers, terminals, magnetic disk drives, and other communication devices.The hardware of the computer is usually divided into three major parts, the central processing unit (CPU) contains an arithmetic and logic unit for manipulating data, a number of registe      rs for storing data, and control circuits for fetching and executing instructions.The hardware of the computer is usually divided into three major parts, the central processing unit (CPU) contains an arithmetic and logic unit for manipulating data, a number of registers for storing data, and control circuits for fetching and executing instructions.
